## Abstract

State-of-the-art hypergraph partitioners utilize a multilevel paradigm to construct progressively coarser hypergraphs across multiple layers, guiding cut refinements at each level of the hierarchy. Traditionally, these partitioners employ heuristic methods for coarsening and do not consider the structural features of hypergraphs.  

In this work, we introduce a multilevel spectral framework, **SHyPar**, for partitioning large-scale hypergraphs by leveraging **hyperedge effective resistances** and **flow-based community detection** techniques. Inspired by recent spectral clustering methods like **HyperEF** and **HyperSF**, SHyPar aims to decompose large hypergraphs into subgraphs with minimal inter-partition hyperedges.  

A key component of SHyPar is a **flow-based local clustering** scheme using a max-flow algorithm to yield clusters with improved conductance. Additionally, SHyPar uses an effective resistance-based rating function to merge strongly coupled nodes.  

Our experiments on real-world VLSI benchmarks show SHyPar achieves **state-of-the-art partition quality** compared to existing hypergraph partitioners.

## Requirements

SHyPar consists of two integrated components:

### 1. Modified HyperEF and HyperSF (for spectral coarsening)

- **Julia Version:** 1.5.3  
- **Required Packages:**
  - `SparseArrays`
  - `LinearAlgebra`
  - `MatrixNetworks v1.0.1`
  - `RandomV06 v0.0.2`

These modules compute **effective resistance** and perform **flow-based community detection**.

### 2. Modified KaHyPar (for partitioning)

SHyPar uses customized versions of [KaHyPar](https://github.com/kahypar/kahypar) to partition the coarsened hypergraphs.

**KaHyPar Requirements:**

- 64-bit OS (Linux/macOS/WSL)
- CMake (build system)
- C++14-compliant compiler (e.g., `g++ >= 9`, `clang >= 11`)
- Boost header files (or use: `-DKAHYPAR_USE_MINIMAL_BOOST=ON` to build locally)

> Please refer to the documentation of [HyperEF](https://github.com/Feng-Research/HyperEF), [HyperSF](https://github.com/Feng-Research/HyperSF), and [KaHyPar](https://github.com/kahypar/kahypar) for further installation details.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Feng-Research/SHyPar.git
cd SHyPar
```

Then, install and build components with:

```bash
chmod +x Install_SHyPar.sh
./Install_SHyPar.sh
```

This script:
- Installs necessary Julia packages
- Builds modified versions of KaHyPar

---

## Running SHyPar

To run SHyPar on your own hypergraph:

1. Place your `.hgr` (hMetis format) hypergraph file in the `data/` directory.
2. Make the run script executable:

```bash
chmod +x Run_SHyPar.sh
```

3. Run SHyPar with the following command:

```bash
./Run_SHyPar.sh <hypergraph_filename> <#coarsening_levels> <#partitions> <imbalance>
```

### Example:

```bash
./Run_SHyPar.sh dataset.hgr 4 8 0.04
```

This runs SHyPar on `dataset.hgr` with 4 levels of coarsening, dividing into 8 partitions, allowing up to 4% imbalance.
